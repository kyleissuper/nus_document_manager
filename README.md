# nus_document_manager
All my documents in one place AND a document printing manager

*It's a pain in the ass to print lecture notes. This service hosts users' newest IVLE + previous year exam papers, and allows an administrator to set the 'printed' statuses of every document. I meant to use this only for myself, but I figure this may be useful for more people, too :)*

Add the following before running scripts:
* settings.py with variables defined: DB (MongoDB DB), COLL (MongoDB Collection), FILE_DIR, and ENV
* make new directory FILE_DIR
